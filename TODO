Check for optional args in steps, and flag if mispelt etc.
eg, WORKING_DIR in bashScript

Overriding context env var from with_var of calling runnable doesn't override.

  - name: deploy-webserver
    service: webserver
    dir: "{{SUBSCRIPTION_DIR}}"
    depends_on:
      - name: deploy-microservice
        with_vars:
          VALUES_FILE: "infrastructure/helm/generic_values.yaml"
          CHART_DIR: "{{HELM_CHARTS_DIR}}/override" <--- this doesn't override





Version check on Ozonefile.

ContextStep step -> should probably force name being set to give better error messages.

document:
Conditional script should return 3 for exit that is a real error. All others should be ignored.
